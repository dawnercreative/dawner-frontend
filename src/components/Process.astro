    <h2>Process Overview</h2>
    <div class="item">
      <h4>Step 1: Initial Consultation</h4>
      <p
        >Our journey begins with a meeting to explore your vision and
        objectives, aimed at fully understanding your project's core. This
        meeting can be scheduled through Calendly, conducted over the phone, or
        held in person, according to your preference. Bringing a brief overview
        of your business and any design inspirations to this session would be
        greatly beneficial. However, if you're at the outset with no prior
        groundwork, that's perfectly fine as well.</p

      <h4>Step 2: Proposal</h4>
      <p
        >Based on our initial consultation, we'll provide a proposal outlining
        the scope of work, timeline, and cost.</p
      >
    </div>
    <div class="item">
      <h4>Step 3: Design</h4>
      <p
        >During the design phase, we utilize the insights and inspirations
        you've shared to begin crafting your site. We'll stay connected with you
        throughout this journey, refining our designs to achieve your ideal
        outcome. While having specific ideas or sources of inspiration is
        beneficial, don't worry if you're starting from square oneâ€”we're here to
        guide you from the ground up.</p

    <div class="item">
      <h4>Step 4: Development</h4>
      <p
        >This phase is the most extensive, as it's where your vision transforms
        into a tangible, interactive reality. It involves meticulous coding,
        integrating SEO best practices, ensuring responsive design for optimal
        viewing on all devices, and rigorous testing for functionality and user
        experience. Throughout this process, we'll keep you informed with
        regular progress updates.</p
